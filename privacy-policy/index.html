            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <h3>Last updated: 26 June 2023</h3>
     <p>
        "We," "Us," or "Our" in this policy refers to the team behind BasketballBot and does not include any other services or websites linked to our services.
<br>
"Service" or "Services" refers to all the services provided by us, including but not limited to BasketballBot.

DATA WE COLLECT<br> 
Per Server<br>
When the bot joins a Discord server, we save a unique identifier (ID) for server-specific settings, such as determining which commands can be used in certain channels.
<br><br>
Per User<br>
When a user first interacts with the bot's internal economy system, we store another unique identifier, allowing us to store balances, prediction records, and similar essential data for the bot's core features.
<br><br>
WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR DATA<br>
We do not and will not share any collected information with anyone unless legally obligated to do so.
<br><br>
DATA RETENTION<br>
We will retain all collected data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. If you wish to have your data removed, you may contact us through Discord using the link provided in the "Contact us" section below.
<br><br>   
UPDATES TO THIS POLICY<br>
We may update this policy periodically. The revised version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and will be available on this page.
